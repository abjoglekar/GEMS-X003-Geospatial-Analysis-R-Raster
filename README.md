# X003.0 An Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis in R

This course is designed for those who are interested in explicitly accounting for location in their analyses. Through this 3-week introductory course, you will learn how to work with spatial data in R, starting from importing different spatial datasets and creating simple maps, to conducting basic geocomputation on vector and raster data. In each 2.5 hour lecture, you will have the opportunity to immediately practice your new skills via hands-on exercises focused on agri-food applications.

-   Week 1: Introduction to spatial data and mapping in R
-   Week 2: Basic geocomputation with vector data in R
-   Week 3: Basic geocomputation with raster data in R

## Prerequisites:

-   Installation of latest version of R and RStudio on your own machine
-   Introductory knowledge of R and RStudio
